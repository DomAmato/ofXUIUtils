ofxGUI and ofxUI are nice but I wanted to have options that didn't require panels and allowed for more freedom in their style. Buttons can be toggles or momentary. I also wanted color pickers of all sorts of sizes and styles.  

##List of Features
* Image Buttons
* Normal Buttons
* Color Pickers
* Text Fields
* Dropdown Menus 

Includes @Flightphase ofxTextInputField as the current text input methods, works well for the light weight nature of the utilities.

Drop down menus adapted from @igiso's ofxCopyPasteText



## To Do:
* Sliders
